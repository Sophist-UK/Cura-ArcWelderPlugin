"If larger arcs appear flat, it's likely that G2/G3 is disabled. This applies "
"to Marlin 1.x (but NOT Marlin 2), Klipper (can be fixed by changing "
"settings), and a few others. If you notice small radius arcs that print with "
"a flat edge, you may need to enable firmware compensation. Note that "
"compression may be reduced (perhaps drastically) when firmware compensation "
"is enabled."
