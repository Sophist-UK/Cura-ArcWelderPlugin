    "description": "Converts multiple subsequent G0/G1 moves to G2/G3 arcs. This reduces the number of gcode commands necessary to make curved movements, thus potentially removing stutter caused by buffer under-runs in the 3d printer controller.\n\nThis plugin uses ArcWelder by @FormerLurker: https://github.com/FormerLurker/ArcWelderLib\n\nThe plugin adds several settings to the 'Special Modes' category in Cura. The 'Arc Welder' setting needs to be checked to enable ArcWelder processing. See the plugin website for a more thorough description of the settings.\n\nThe development of this plugin can be sponsored via Github Sponsors (https://github.com/sponsors/fieldofview) or Paypal (https://www.paypal.me/fieldofview)",
